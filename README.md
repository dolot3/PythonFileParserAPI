This API basically accepts files of certain types that are pushed to it, parses the data, inserts the data into the database, and then archives the file.  This project came about when a friend of mine, who has his own business, wanted to learn Python.  He didn't have the time to learn it, so he paid me to create this API for him so he could use it as an example to learn from.  This code is currently in production - running on a microcomputer - in an industrial setting.
